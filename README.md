## Summary:
Create custom definitions for any text (e.g. words, symbols, phrases). When you come across a page containing the text you've defined before, you can annotate the defined text where it appears on the page to remind yourself what that is.
## Description:
Learning a new language? Having trouble recognizing new words or symbols?

Dictionaries are too inconvenient and interrupt reading practice.
Translation services are too convenient and remove the practice completely.

Create custom mappings with the right level of coverage for you. From translations above every new word you learn to personal mnemonics and hints for how to read new symbols, let your own guides follow you across the web at the click of a button. 

"But where do I start?"

Use one of the built-in default mappings and edit it to fit your needs.
